# Azure_Pipelines
Project Introduction
The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics to accomplish 
two primary objectives:

1. Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
2. Make the data available to the interested public to show how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.

Requirement: create high-quality data pipelines that are dynamic, can be automated, and monitored for efficient operation. 
The source data resides in Azure Data Lake and needs to be processed in a NYC data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics. 
The source datasets consist of CSV files with Employee master data and monthly payroll data entered by various City agencies.

Project Environment

several Azure resources will be used:

1. Azure Data Lake Gen2 
2. Azure SQL DB
3. Azure Data Factory
3. Azure Synapse Analytics (Using dedicated sql pool and spark pool)
